How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
It allowed me to see exactly what
changes were made so I only had to inspect
lines that could have been potential
causes of the bug.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
It could allow me to restore functions that
once existed in the code but I had deleted along
the way because I thought I wouldn't need them.
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
That way you can logically separate your work and additions.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file
separately?
Because git is often used to save code for programs that
often have interrelated files.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
you just use them...
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
Because you know you can always revert to an old version.
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
to make a change to the pandas library (fix a bug).
